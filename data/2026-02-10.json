      "summary": "A proposal to adjust the ranking algorithm on Lobsters by reducing the \"hotness\" score for posts tagged with \"vibe coding\" by 0.25 points. This would make AI-assisted coding content slightly less prominent in the feed without outright filtering it. The change reflects ongoing community debate about the volume and quality of LLM-related development content.",

        "sentiment": "Community appears divided on how to handle the influx of AI coding content. Some support algorithmic dampening as a middle ground between banning and status quo, while others argue it's premature or won't solve underlying content quality issues. Concerns about defining \"vibe coding\" and potential tag gaming are prominent."
